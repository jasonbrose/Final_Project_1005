In this project, I provide many summary statistics about Harvard College, such as the largest classes, and also analyze the growth of the various departments by enrollments and course offerings. This project is the first step in a much more ambitious endeavor to gain insight into Harvard's academic ecosystem and gain a more thorough understanding of the interests, motivations, and experiences of Harvard Students from all corners of the college."),

For example: why is there such a weak relationship between courses offered by departments and enrollments in those departments? Areas for further study include course load of professors by department, the relationship between a professor's course and/or enrollment load and that professor's compensation, the relationship between professor department and professor compensation, and many more."),
